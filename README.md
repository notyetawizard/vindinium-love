# vindinium-love
A Vindinium client on the LÃ–VE framework

Not currently in a usable state.

Plans to:

- Include a light graphics system so that a browser is not needed to watch the game.

- Make it easy to load different bots and strategies on the fly or by cli

- Include mode, turn, map setting on the fly or by cli
